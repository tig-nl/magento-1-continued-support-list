# Listing of extensions providing support after Magento 1 EOL

Magento is planning to end the support of Magento 1 in June 2020. But will this be the end of the many extensions that have been created by all the extension developers?

This list is to provide an overview of various extension developers and their extensions and the support that they will (or won't) deliver after Magento officially drops the support for Magento 1.

Feel free to fork off this repository and create a pull request to supplement this list.
