# List of extensions providing support after Magento 1 EOL

Magento is planning to end the support of Magento 1 in June 2020. What does this mean for the extensions that we've developed for Magento?

This list provides an overview of extensions available for Magento 1 and the support that will (or will not) be delivered after Magento officially drops its support for Magento 1.

Feel free to fork off this repository and create a pull request to update this list.
